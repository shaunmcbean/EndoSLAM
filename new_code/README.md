## üöÄ Running the Project

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Train and Evaluate the Model

Run the following commands to train the depth estimation model and evaluate it:

```bash
python3 new_model.py \
  --image_dir [PATH TO RGB TRAINING IMAGES] \
  --depth_dir [PATH TO TRAINING DEPTH CHART IMAGES] \
  --epochs [NUMBER OF EPOCHS] \
  --batch_size [BATCH SIZE]

python3 eval_model.py \
  --model_path [PATH TO SAVED MODEL] \
  --image_dir [PATH TO RGB EVAL IMAGES] \
  --depth_dir [PATH TO EVAL DEPTH CHART IMAGES] \
  --output_dir [PATH TO RESULTS DIRECTORY]
```
## üß† Code Overview
This section explains the functionality of the key scripts in this repository.

### üìÑ new_model.py
Trains a self-supervised monocular depth estimation model using endoscopic RGB video frames.

**Arguments:**

*--``image_dir``: Path to RGB training images.

*--``depth_dir``: Path to corresponding ground-truth depth charts (optional, for validation).

*--``epochs``: Number of training epochs.

*--``batch_size``: Number of images per batch.

**Functionality:**

*Loads image and depth data.

*Builds and trains a convolutional neural network to predict per-pixel depth.

*Implements self-supervised loss functions:

*Photometric loss between adjacent frames.

*Smoothness loss to regularize depth output.

*Saves model checkpoints during training.
